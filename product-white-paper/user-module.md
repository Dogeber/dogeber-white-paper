## Login Method

Different from traditional web2.0 applications, we no longer need to tediously register and enter account and password to log in.&#x20;

When your encrypted connection to the platform is regarded as a login or registration behavior, the system will judge your connection history and identify whether you have ever logged in or registered on this platform.

Your public key is your unique identity on the platform.

## Creating a project

Hit the big '+' button in your sidebar and select 'New Project' from the menu that pops up. Give your project a name, and you're good to go!
